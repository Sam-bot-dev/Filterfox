✅ What is a Web Crawler?

A web crawler is a program (bot) that:

Finds web pages

Visits them

Reads their content

Extracts links from them

Repeats the process

Stores everything for searching later

Think of it like a robot explorer that travels across the internet collecting pages.

🧠 Why do we need a crawler in Filter_fox?

Because if you want a real search engine, you need your own database of pages.

Google doesn’t “search the live internet every time you type”.
It searches its own stored index.

So your crawler’s job is to build your collection of pages.
