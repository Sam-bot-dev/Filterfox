✅ What is a Web Crawler?

A web crawler is a program (bot) that:

Finds web page

Visits them

Reads their content

Extracts links from them

Repeats the process

Stores everything for searching later

Think of it like a robot explorer that travels across the internet collecting pages.

🧠 Why do we need a crawler in Filter_fox?

Because if you want a real search engine, you need your own database of pages.

Google doesn’t “search the live internet every time you type”.
It searches its own stored index.

So your crawler’s job is to build your collection of pages.

🚦 Important rules a crawler must follow (real-world)
1) Robots.txt (Respect website rules)

Many sites have a file:
/robots.txt

It tells crawlers:

allowed pages

disallowed pages

crawl delay

Example:

Disallow: /private


So your crawler should respect it.

2) Rate limiting (Don’t overload sites)

Crawler must not spam requests.
If you send 100 requests/sec → website blocks you.

So you use:
✅ delay per domain

3) Depth limit (Control how deep it goes)

Depth means:

Seed page = depth 0
Links inside = depth 1
Links inside those = depth 2…

Without depth limit it can crawl forever.

4) Domain restrictions (for safety)

In early version, you should crawl only:

specific domain

or selected sites

Example:
crawl only Wikipedia pages.
